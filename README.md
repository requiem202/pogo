# POGO - A quick proof of concept

This small app will list your Pokemon GO's pokemons, sorted by IV.

The output will be in the console and as text file with the same name as your email.

## Usage

Clone this repository and use "node index.js". The app will ask for your Google mail and password.

PTC support was disabled in the code.
